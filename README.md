# SpeedReader
The SpeedReader program was inspired by countless internet demonstrations on the mental capability of the human brain to interpret and understand text displayed at a high rate. This program is designed to allow the user to select a document and have the text displayed at a customizable rate for high-speed reading in last minute situations or casual high speed text consumption.
