# SpeedReader
The SpeedReader program was inspired by countless internet demonstrations on the mental capability of the human brain to interpret and understand text displayed at a high rate. This program is designed to allow the user to select a document and have the text displayed at a customizable rate for high-speed reading in last minute situations or casual high speed text consumption.

At the moment there are three main filetypes supported for use with this program: .PDF, .docx, and .txt. In the future I'm planning on adding support for less common files such as .odt, .tex, .rtf and more.

Another plan in the works is to convert this program to a chrome extention for easy online use for sources like online news articles, books, long reddit posts and other online sources.
